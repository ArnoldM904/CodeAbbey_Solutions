URL : http://www.codeabbey.com/index/task_view/sum-of-two
<BR>
Solution: https://github.com/ArnoldM904/CodeAbbey_Solutions/blob/master/Python/id001-Sum_of_two.py

<strong>Problem 2: Sum in Loop</strong>
<BR>
You are to find sum of several numbers (more than two).
<BR>
URL : http://www.codeabbey.com/index/task_view/sum-in-loop
<BR>
Solution: https://github.com/ArnoldM904/CodeAbbey_Solutions/blob/master/Python/id002-Sum_in_loop.py

<strong>Problem 3: Sums in Loops</strong>
<BR>
You will be given several pairs of values and you need to calculate sum for each pair. 
<BR>
URL : http://www.codeabbey.com/index/task_view/sums-in-loop
<BR>
Solution: https://github.com/ArnoldM904/CodeAbbey_Solutions/blob/master/Python/id003-Sums_in_loop.py

<strong>Problem 4: Minimum of Two</strong>
<BR>
Of two numbers, please, select one with minimum value.
<BR>
URL : http://www.codeabbey.com/index/task_view/min-of-two
<BR>
Solution: https://github.com/ArnoldM904/CodeAbbey_Solutions/blob/master/Python/id004-Minimum_of_Two.py

<strong>Problem 5: Minimum of Three</strong>
<BR>
Several triplets of numbers are given to you. Your task is to select minimum among each of triplets.
<BR>
URL : http://www.codeabbey.com/index/task_view/min-of-three
<BR>
Solution: https://github.com/ArnoldM904/CodeAbbey_Solutions/blob/master/Python/id005-Minimum_of_Three.py

<strong>Problem 6: Rounding</strong>
<BR>
There are several pairs of numbers. For each pair you are to divide first by second and return the result, rounded to nearest integer.
In cases, when result contains exactly 0.5 as a fraction part, value should be rounded up.
<BR>
URL : http://www.codeabbey.com/index/task_view/rounding
<BR>
Solution: https://github.com/ArnoldM904/CodeAbbey_Solutions/blob/master/Python/id006-Rounding.py
